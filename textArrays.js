var aboutText = "Hello. I see you are interested in reading about my game. That's good, because I really want to talk about my game!\n\nIf for some reason you are unaware (maybe you are reading this in the far future and this game is but an artefact from - what must appear to you - a savage, barbarous time where the Moon wasn't even coloized and people were actually allowed to drive cars themselves. Can you imagine! How dangerous that must have been! But I digress) this game was made for a Game Jam hosted on repl.it.\n\nThis whole game was made myself (except for a few libraries I 'borrowed'). As such I have developed a fondness for my creation. From it's early beginnings as a simple platformer to what it is now, I have nurtured it, watched it grow, stuck by it through it's rebellious phase and finally I can marvel at what it has grown up to be.\n\nIs it perfect? Hardly. But I hope as you enjoy my game you see that I have put great effort into even the smallest of details - such as the display turret behaviour on the arena menu (or the grab scolling on this bloody page).\n\nI programmed this game with a JavaScript library/framework called p5.js. For anyone wanting to get into making games and similar things with code, I highly recommend it as it is easy to use, fairly powerful for simple games and - crucially - far better looking that PyGame.\n\nYou may have noticed that my game looks rather dull (at least I think so). That's because I spent far more time on the actual mechanics of the game. Basically all the mechanics were built from the ground up. I could have used a library like matter.js which would do all the physics stuff for me, but where's the fun in that? \n\nSo, let's talk a bit about the mechanics. There's obviously collision detection between the player and the blocks, which is quite simple to implement (although anyone who's actually implemented it knows that there are some deceptively tricky problems to solve). \n\nOn top of the collision detection is a movement mechanic centered around the idea of forces acting on objects. Simply put, Force is proportional to acceleration, and every frame of the game acceleration is added to the velocity and the velocity is added to the position. Very simple and gives the game a nice smooth, Newtonian feel. It also makes adding new forces to the game very easy. The recoil of explosions is an example of something I added very late to the game, but it was very easy to add because of the way the game works.\n\n(Again, for anyone interested in game development, if you want to use this type of Force based mechanic you need to have air resistance and friction as forces acting in the opposite direction of the players movement, otherwise the player will just accelerate to infinity.)\n\nAnother late addition (and the thing I am most proud of) is the grappling hooks block wrapping mechanic. Previously, the rope would just pass straight through blocks. You got used to it after a while, but I thought that for this to be even a halfway decent game I would need to fix it. It took me three full days to figure it out (it's a deceptively tricky problem) and it was completely worth it. If you have played the game and didn't even think twice about the rope wrapping around blocks, you're welcome.\n\nAnother bit I am proud of is the predictive turret, specifically the super predictive turret. The scatter predictive turret was my first attempt at predictive firing in the game, but it didn't work very well, so I made it shoot volleys of bullets instead. The super predictive on the other hand was the culmination of about 4 or 5 days of working non-stop at the problem. Basically, when it fires it takes the players current position, velocity, acceleration, and any forces acting on it, then simulates the players movement a given number of steps into the future, taking into account the pull of gravity, the changing magnitude of friction and drag (which change as velocity changes), predicts any collisions the player may have with the surrounding blocks, and then fires a deadly accurate shot at the angle with the highest probability of killing the player. Marvelous!\n\nAlthough I have acheived a lot in making this game (in my humble opinion), there are many things I wish I could have added but couldn't because of the limited time. These include more levels, more turret types and even a two player mode (which I promised but was unable to complete). Maybe I will continue developing the game after the jam is over, just as a little hobby project of mine.\n\nAnyway, that's it from me. I hope you enjoy playing my game as much as I have enjoyed making it.\n\n- Matt";
